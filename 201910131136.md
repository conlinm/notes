1. the fhir client must be included in your app. This is the file "fhir-client.js" which is an open source javascript library to assist with calling a fhir API and handling the SMART on FHIR authorization. The file is located at https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/client-js
   1. Get this file. It should be a file in your app, not referenced via a script tag.
      1. this can be installed via NPM `npm install fhirclient`
      2. Or install the latest build from: https://combinatronics.com/smart-on-fhir/client-js/master/dist/build/fhir-client.js
2. The app will need two separate pages that correspond to the launch_uri and redirect_uri
   1. the launch_uri
      1. this is the launch page. It will be launched by 
         1. the ehr if it is an app within the ehr (or Cerner code console), and is 'launch.html' in the sample app, or
         2. a stand alone app, 'launch-patient.html' in the sample app
         3. This is the entry point for your app, and will begin the SMART authorization process.
   2. redirect-uri
      1. This is the index page to land after authorization
3. Register the app with the Cerner code console at https://code.cerner.com/developer/smart-on-fhir/apps
   1. I am registered using conlinm@ohsu.edu, it seems to logon automatically.
   2. Table of usual fields and content to add a new app.
