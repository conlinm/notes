#### Steps in the tutorial

1. the fhir client must be included in your app. This is the file "fhir-client.js" which is an open source javascript library to assist with calling a fhir API and handling the SMART on FHIR authorization. The file is located at https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/client-js
   1. Get this file. It should be a file in your app, not referenced via a script tag.
      1. this can be installed via NPM `npm install fhirclient`
      2. Or install the latest build from: https://combinatronics.com/smart-on-fhir/client-js/master/dist/build/fhir-client.js
2. The app will need two separate pages that correspond to the launch_uri and redirect_uri
   1. the launch_uri
      1. this is the launch page. It will be launched by 
         1. the ehr if it is an app within the ehr (or Cerner code console), and is 'launch.html' in the sample app, or
         2. a stand alone app, 'launch-patient.html' in the sample app
         3. This is the entry point for your app, and will begin the SMART authorization process.
   2. redirect-uri
      1. This is the index page to land after authorization
3. Register the app with the Cerner code console at https://code.cerner.com/developer/smart-on-fhir/apps
   1. I am registered using conlinm@ohsu.edu, it seems to logon automatically.
   2. Table of usual fields and content to add a new app.
   
   
| Field | Description |
|------- | ------- |
| App Name | `My amazing SMART app` Any name will do |
| SMART Launch URI | `https://<gh-username>.github.io/smart-on-fhir-tutorial/example-smart-app/launch.html` |
| Redirect URI | `https://<gh-username>.github.io/smart-on-fhir-tutorial/| example-smart-app/`|
| App Type | `Provider` Provider facing app |
| FHIR Spec	| `dstu2` The latest spec version supported by Cerner |
| Authorized | `Yes` Authorized App will go through secured OAuth 2 login |
| Standard Scopes | These scopes are required to launch the SMART app |
| User Scopes | None |
| Patient Scopes | Locate the Patient Scopes table and select the Patient read and Observation read scopes |

#### Flow of a SMART app launch

1. Provider App
   1. The provider indicates a desire to launch our app from within Cerner Millennium EHR
   2. This triggers the EHR to redirect to the SMART `Launch URI` that was registered
   3. The app discovers the authorization server from the FHIR server
   4. This launch URI redirects to the FHIR authorization server to authenticate
   5. Once authenticated, the app redirects to the `Redirect URI`
   6. After authentication, the redirect URI (sample app `index.html`) exchanges the returned authorization token for an access token which allows access to the FHIR resources from Cerner.
2. Patient App
   1. Similar but not launched from within Cerner, only standalone patient apps allowed

#### Requesting Authorization
The launch URI will redirect to eht FHIR authorization server to request authorization. This is done with the help of the fhir-client, by using the method `FHIR.oauth2.authorize` as demonstrated in the example below:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <title>Example-SMART-App</title>
  </head>
  Loading...
  <body>
    <script src='./lib/fhir-client-v0.1.11.js'></script>
    <!-- Prevent session bleed caused by single threaded embedded browser and sessionStorage API -->
    <!-- https://github.com/cerner/fhir-client-cerner-additions -->
    <script src='./lib/fhir-client-cerner-additions-1.0.0.js'></script>
    <script>
      FHIR.oauth2.authorize({
        'client_id': '<enter your client id here>',
        'scope':  'patient/Patient.read patient/Observation.read launch online_access openid profile'
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The client_id is supplied by the Cerner code console after the app  has been registered.
This oath2 client_id is an identifier not a secret, so it does not need to be hidden. 

How does the `FHIR.oath2.authorize` method work?
 When the EHR launches the app, `launch.html` will be supplied two query params; `iss` and `launch`.
 `iss` is the EHR's FHIR end point
 `launch` is an identifier that will be passes along to the authorization server

 1. The method queries the FHIR endpoint to find the URI for authorization.
 2. The API is filled out passing the supplied client_id, scopes, and the launch parameter. There are others available at http://docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization
 3. The function generates a `state` parameter that will be checked after redirecting to the index page.
 4. The app will then redirect to the authorization server, and after successful authorization, will redirect to the `Redirect URI` 

#### Scopes that are required:
1. patient/Patient.read
2. patient/Observation.read
3. openid, profile
4. launch
5. launch/patient (only for patient facing standalone apps)
6. online_access
