"Dear Mr. Conlin

I am Tommy Kang who is Junior in Westside Christian HS, and I got your email address from Mr. Ball, college counselor in our school.

One of the school's assignment is to have a "coffee" interview with people who already have a profession in the field that I am interested in.

I know that you are a professional in Urology, but I only have general questions about medical doctor since I haven't chosen a specific area of profession. 

I will appreciate it very much if you answer my questions, and please do not take more than 15 minutes to answer my questions, since your time is very valuable.

What do you do in this job?  What are your daily, weekly and monthly duties?
What was the series of jobs and events which led you to this particular position?
What do you like most and least about your current job?
What is the work environment like? (hours, location, co-workers, etc.)
What personality types or strengths are most important in this field of work?
What is the salary range for this position?
For this current position, what specific area/major would you need to study in college?
What advice would you give to a high school student like me who may be considering this or one of the other positions you’ve held during your work career?

Again, thank you so much for your time,
Tommy Kang"

I am currently in a role as chair of a group of surgeons and nurses working on configuring a new electronic health record for the VA hospital system across the country. This will only last a year so I will answer your questions based upon my usual work as a urologist.

1. I am a urologist. This is a surgical specialty dealing with problems of the genitourinary tract. I specialize in kidney stones and tumors, so I see patients with these problems in the clinic, and I perform operations for these problems.
Daily - depends on if I am in the clinic or the operating room. But usually it involves seeing patients in the hospital (‘rounding’) that I have operated on, with the residents who are training with us, usually around 6:30 or 7 AM, then off to clinic or OR for the day. There will be a schedule of patients to see in the clinic or operate on in the OR. Then we often make rounds at the end of the day. There are always disruptions to the day, with emergencies or urgent consults that need our attention, and this is fun, keeps it fresh and you never know what the day will bring.
Weekly - we have a variety of conference to attend weekly, grand rounds, teaching conference, etc. Generally, I work Monday through Friday, probably average 10 hours per day.
Monthly - not much different monthly - most weeks are the same. We do have regional, national and international meeting we attend for scientific and academic purposes, that each occur about once a year.

2. I became a Christian in High School, and one of my new friends was very involved with the Muscular Dystrophy Association in Dallas. He was in high school, but was a leader of the summer camp - he got me involved. We each took care of one boy with MD, and all of his personal care needs, for the week of camp. Changed his clothes, bathed him, got him in his wheelchair. It was a lot of nursing care. I really loved it. While at camp, I met a physician who encouraged me to pursue medicine. In medical school, I knew I wanted to be a surgeon, and after rotating on the urology service, I learned more about the field, and it definitely seemed to fit me.

3. I love the people. I do not like the regulations and documentation requirements that take more and more of my time.

4. Coworkers are great, hours - about 40-60 hours per week, but it doesn’t seem too much. I work at OHSU, and the VA hospital, so a large academic medical center where I also do research and train residents.

5. Care for people, interest in science, love to learn, resiliency, strong sense of self (and strength from God), so you can take criticism and failure and keep moving and serving and enjoy it.

6. $200,000 to $400,000 generally, depending on the type of practice and where you work.

7. You need a science background, but you do not have to have a science degree. Many people in medical school have degrees in liberal arts areas. This is often encouraged to be well balanced, but you will have to meet the science requirements for admission to medical school. My undergraduate degree is in biochemistry.

8. Do it. We need good physicians. I love it. It is hard work, but so are a lot of other jobs out there. It is hard, there will be times you are emotionally drained caring for people in their times of desperation, but you can be an instrument of God’s healing and peace. The medical profession is incredibly rewarding.

I am also happy to have coffee sometime if you’d like.
