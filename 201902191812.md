# Importing data into a numpy array
Numpy is particularly suited for managing numerical arrays. An example of this is an image representation which can be a 2 dimensional array of numbers indicating RGB values. Numpy is not as good at storing arrays of mixed datatypes, for that we use pandas.

## importing data using loadtxt

When using numpy, we don’t have to open a connection to a file, numpy does that for us:

	filename = 'MNIST.txt'
	data = np.loadtxt(filename, delimiter=',')

The delimiter must be declared (default is whitespace). The other most common option is ‘t’ for tab-delimited, but any string can be used.
You can also choose the data type with dtype, the default is float. You can be selective with the column to read with usecols= int (for single col) or sequence (like `[0,2]`for column 1 and 3)
