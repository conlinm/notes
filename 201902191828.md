# importing data using genfromtxt
Since numpy arrays are designed to work with numerical data, there will be problems bringing in a table with different data types, which is often the case. Usually the best method of dealing with this type of data in python is to use a panda data frame to store the data. However, if you wish to use the data in numpy alone (why?) then you can use np.genfromtxt. This function   is designed to better manage data of different type, missing data, and other issues. This function uses a structured array approach to storing data. It turns the table of data in our text file into a 1 dimensional array, that is each element in the array is one entire row of the original file.

	filename = 'somefile.txt'
	data = np.genfromtxt(filename, delimiter=',', name=True)
Name=True refers to the headers

There is also another related function, np.recfromcsv() which is the same as genfromtxt, but with the default delimiter being csv, default dtype=None (so numpy has to figure it out) and name=True.
