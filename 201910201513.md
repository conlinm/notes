I was completing the work on analyzing turnover times from Spokane data. There are entries in the field that I am using for 'patient in the OR' that are earlier that when the prior patient is out of the OR (i.e., impossible). I discovered how to grab data from the adjacent column in SQL, but now I am faced with some negative numbers for the turnover time. Assuming that these are misentered, or perhaps a nurse entered the time the patient first arrived in the holding area, rather than the actual OR, and that the other entries are correct, I want to remove all those calculated turnover times that are negative, using pandas. I found [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.25/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.mask.html#pandas.DataFrame.mask](pandas.DataFrame.mask) which will "replace values where the condition is true." It is clean and simple.
```
In [2]: import pandas as pd

In [3]: df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [0, -1, 2], 'b': [-3, 2, 1]})

In [4]: df
Out[4]: 
   a  b
0  0 -3
1 -1  2
2  2  1
```
Replace negative numbers with 0:
```
In [5]: df.mask(df < 0, 0)
Out[5]: 
   a  b
0  0  0
1  0  2
2  2  1
```
Or, more appropriately, replace negative numbers with NaN:
```
In [7]: df.mask(df < 0)
Out[7]: 
     a    b
0  0.0  NaN
1  NaN  2.0
2  2.0  1.0
```
