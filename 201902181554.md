# Importing a text file into python

You can read a file into python by creating a connection to a file using 'open'.
So if we have a text file that we want to use, first we assign the filename to variable: `filename = 'huck_finn.txt'`
Then we want to create an open connection to the file itself using 'open'.
`file = open(filename, mode='r)`
Notice the option for mode. Here we use 'r' for read only (we don't want to modify the file itself) or 'w' for write, when our intention is to write back or chang the file itself.
Now the variable 'file' is just the connection to the file. We then use this open connection represented by 'file' to read the file using the read method:
`text=file.read()`
Then you can do something like print it or modify it. But whatever is done, after you have finished, you have to remember to close the connection:
`file.close()`
