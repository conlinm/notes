### Git Basic commands

git clone means you are making a copy of the repository in your system.

git fork means you are copying the repository to your Github account.

git pull means you are fetching the last modified repository.

git push means you are returning the repository after modifying it.

In layman's term:

git clone is downloading and git pull is refreshing.

git clone is how you get a local copy of an existing repository to work on. It's usually only used once for a given repository, unless you want to have multiple working copies of it around. (Or want to get a clean copy after messing up your local one...)

git pull (or git fetch + git merge) is how you update that local copy with new commits from the remote repository. If you are collaborating with others, it is a command that you will run frequently.
