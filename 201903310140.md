Nice presentation of powerplans by Evan. PowerPlans are ordersets, but have additional functionality. One example are phases of the plans, for example pre-op, and post-op. Theses phases can be initiated at different times, and allows you to write all the orders for a case ahead of time. Another is the ability to customize and save PowerPlans, and share them to be copied. So this can allow an attending to save all his favorite PowerPlans and share them with Residents who can save and modify them. This is a significant improvement from having to have CACs make changes to the ordersets.
Orders are added to PowerPlans by using the plus sign add button. Details of the order ca be specified, and if the plan is saved these are all saved as well. 
It was pointed out by Kristin that surginet was a separate program, but now it is just part of powerChart. 
PowerPlans can be sent to groups to be signed. As long as a powerPlan has not been initiated, it can be moved to a different date, if the case is re-scheduled for instance.
